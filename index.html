  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boston University</strong> – Bachelor of Arts in Economics, Class of 2023<br>

  <h2>Books I Recommend</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a> – Daniel Kahneman<br>
      Kahneman, a Nobel laureate, breaks down how we think in two systems: fast (intuitive) and slow (deliberate). I recommend it because it made me reflect on my biases and shaped how I approach problem-solving in business.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://danariely.com/books/predictably-irrational/" target="_blank"><em>Predictably Irrational</em></a> – Dan Ariely<br>
      Ariely explains how humans make irrational decisions in systematic and predictable ways. I loved how it merged psychology with economics, and it pushed me to understand how to influence decision-making in strategic work.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</em></a> – Eric Jorgenson (compiled from Naval's thoughts)<br>
      This isn’t a traditional book — it’s a collection of Naval’s ideas on wealth, happiness, and leverage. I go back to it regularly because it feels timeless and highly applicable to both career and life decisions.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)" target="_blank"><em>Nudge</em></a> – Richard H. Thaler & Cass R. Sunstein<br>
      Thaler and Sunstein give real-life examples of how to steer people toward better decisions without forcing them. I recommend it because it connects behavioral science with public policy and product design in a way that’s easy to apply.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Podcasts I Like</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://nav.al/podcast" target="_blank"><strong>Naval</strong></a> – Naval Ravikant<br>
      Naval's podcast is short, dense, and packed with wisdom. I listen to it for perspective on how to think independently, build leverage, and prioritize peace over busy-ness.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/archive/" target="_blank"><strong>Freakonomics Radio</strong></a> – Hosted by Stephen Dubner<br>
      This show dives into the unexpected side of everyday topics using data. I recommend it because it shows how economic thinking can explain (and sometimes debunk) how the world works.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/" target="_blank"><strong>The Knowledge Project</strong></a> – Hosted by Shane Parrish<br>
      A long-form podcast featuring deep thinkers and decision-makers. It helps me refine how I think and exposes me to mental models that improve personal and professional clarity.
    </li>

  <h2>Stocks I Recommend</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #777;">*Live stock prices below are sourced from the <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co" target="_blank">Alpha Vantage API</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway <span style="color: #444">(NYSE: <strong>BRK.B</strong>)</span></a>:</strong><br>
      Current Stock Price: <span id="brkb-stock-price" style="color: #0a84ff; font-weight: bold;">Loading...</span><br>
      Led by Warren Buffett, Berkshire is a long-term compounder that reflects patient, value-driven investing. I recommend it because Buffett’s discipline, track record, and crisis timing have consistently outperformed over decades.
    </li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://solenotx.com/" target="_blank">Soleno Therapeutics <span style="color: #444">(NASDAQ: <strong>SLNO</strong>)</span></a>:</strong><br>
      Current Stock Price: <span id="slno-stock-price" style="color: #0a84ff; font-weight: bold;">Loading...</span><br>
      Soleno is working on a breakthrough therapy for Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a rare condition affecting 1 in 15,000 people. I like it for its potential social and medical impact — it’s a true asymmetric opportunity.
    </li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/" target="_blank">SPDR Gold Shares <span style="color: #444">(NYSEARCA: <strong>GLD</strong>)</span></a>:</strong><br>
      Current Stock Price: <span id="gld-stock-price" style="color: #0a84ff; font-weight: bold;">Loading...</span><br>
      GLD is a low-cost way to gain exposure to gold. I recommend it as a strategic hedge during times of inflation, market volatility, and broader economic uncertainty.
    </li>
  </ul>
